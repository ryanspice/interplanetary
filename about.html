Interplanetary is the misadventures of 2 unwilling companions, Krakko captain of his ship the Pigeon DB 9 and Alec his equally despondent friend, a sheep with godlike powers but who only uses them when he feels like it , which is conveniently, and mostly , never.  This is not a story for the light of heart, for It is a journey not only to te deepest , but also, darkest regions of space. Where true lawlessness exists within the stars, and space pirates and smugglers clashn with deadly bounty hunters and police for control of the vast regions of the galaxy.
